# UEBA - User and Entity Behavior Analytics

---

## 5.1 What is UEBA?

**User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)** is a cybersecurity process that uses advanced analytics, including machine learning and statistical analysis, to monitor and analyze the behavior of users and entities (such as devices, applications, and systems) within a network.

The goal of UEBA is to detect **anomalous behavior** that may indicate insider threats, compromised accounts, or sophisticated attacks that traditional security tools might miss.

---

## 5.2 Why UEBA is Important

- Detects **insider threats** by identifying deviations from normal user or entity behavior.
- Identifies **compromised credentials** used in unusual ways.
- Helps detect **advanced persistent threats (APTs)** and **zero-day attacks**.
- Complements other security tools like SIEM and EDR by providing behavioral context.
- Reduces false positives by focusing on unusual activity rather than known signatures.

## 5.3 How UEBA Works

UEBA systems collect and analyze data from multiple sources, including:

- User activity logs (login/logout, file access, privilege use)
- Network traffic patterns
- Endpoint behavior
- Application usage
- Cloud service interactions

Using this data, UEBA builds a **baseline of normal behavior** for each user and entity. It then applies **machine learning algorithms** and statistical models to detect deviations that could indicate malicious activity.

## 5.4 Key UEBA Features

| Feature                   | Description                                                  |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Behavior Baseline**      | Establishes normal patterns for users and entities.          |
| **Anomaly Detection**      | Identifies deviations from baseline behavior.                 |
| **Risk Scoring**           | Assigns risk scores to detected anomalies for prioritization. |
| **Entity Correlation**     | Links related anomalies across users and devices.             |
| **Alert Generation**       | Raises alerts for suspicious behavior that warrants investigation. |
| **Visualization & Reporting** | Provides dashboards and reports to SOC analysts.          |

## 5.5 Common UEBA Use Cases

- **Insider Threat Detection:** Spotting employees accessing data or systems they normally wouldnâ€™t.
- **Compromised Account Detection:** Identifying login attempts from unusual locations or times.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Detecting unauthorized elevation of user privileges.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Monitoring unusual data access or transfer patterns.
- **Credential Abuse:** Detecting use of stolen credentials or lateral movement within the network.

## 5.6 UEBA vs. Traditional Security Tools

| Aspect             | Traditional Tools (e.g., SIEM)                | UEBA                                    |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Detection Method   | Signature-based or rule-based detection      | Behavior and anomaly-based detection    |
| Focus             | Known threats and events                      | Unknown or emerging threats via behavior|
| Data Analyzed     | Logs and alerts                               | User/entity behavior over time          |
| False Positives    | Often high due to rigid rules                  | Lower due to contextual risk scoring    |
| Use Case          | Compliance, alerting on known attack patterns | Detecting insider threats, APTs, unknown attacks |

## 5.7 Challenges of UEBA

- **Data Quality:** Requires high-quality, diverse data for accurate baselines.
- **Privacy Concerns:** Monitoring user behavior must balance security and privacy rights.
- **Complexity:** Implementing and tuning UEBA requires skilled personnel.
- **Integration:** Works best when integrated with SIEM, EDR, and SOAR.
- **False Negatives:** Some sophisticated attacks may mimic normal behavior.

---

## 5.8 Best Practices for UEBA Deployment

- Collect data from a wide range of sources to build comprehensive behavior models.
- Regularly update and tune behavioral baselines.
- Combine UEBA alerts with other security tools to improve detection accuracy.
- Establish clear incident response procedures for UEBA alerts.
- Ensure compliance with privacy laws and organizational policies.
- Train SOC analysts on interpreting UEBA risk scores and alerts.

# Introduction to SOC

## What is a Security Operations Center (SOC)?
A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a centralized unit that continuously monitors, detects, investigates, and responds to cybersecurity threats.

### SOC Structure
- **Tier 1 (Alert Analyst):** Monitors and triages alerts.
- **Tier 2 (Incident Responder):** Investigates incidents.
- **Tier 3 (Threat Hunter):** Proactively hunts threats.

### Why SOC Matters
SOC ensures early detection, continuous defense, and rapid containment of attacks.

### Real-World Example
Imagine multiple failed logins from global IPs â€” your SIEM flags it, the SOC investigates and stops a brute-force attack before it escalates.

# Core SOC Concepts

## Cybersecurity Foundations
- **CIA Triad:** Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
- **SOC vs NOC:** SOC focuses on security; NOC ensures uptime.

## Frameworks
- **NIST CSF**
- **MITRE ATT&CK**
- **ISO 27001**

## SOC Process Flow
Detection → Investigation → Response → Recovery

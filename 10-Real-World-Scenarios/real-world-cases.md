# Real-World SOC Scenarios

---

## 10.1 Introduction

Understanding theoretical concepts is essential, but applying them to real-world situations is what truly builds expertise in a Security Operations Center (SOC). This chapter presents practical, realistic SOC scenarios that illustrate common threats, detection strategies, and response actions.

## 10.2 Scenario 1: Phishing Attack Detection and Response

### Overview

An employee receives a phishing email containing a malicious link aiming to harvest credentials.

### Detection

- SIEM alerts triggered by unusual login attempts from geographically distant locations.
- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) flags execution of suspicious scripts.
- User reports suspicious email via phishing reporting tool.

### Response

- Incident Response team isolates affected endpoint.
- Credentials suspected compromised are reset.
- Email filtering rules updated to block similar messages.
- User education reinforcement through targeted awareness training.

### Lessons Learned

- Importance of multi-layered detection (SIEM + EDR + user reporting).
- Need for rapid containment to prevent lateral movement.
- Continuous user awareness reduces risk exposure.

## 10.3 Scenario 2: Insider Threat - Data Exfiltration Attempt

### Overview

A disgruntled employee attempts to copy sensitive files to a USB device and upload data to a personal cloud account.

### Detection

- Data Loss Prevention (DLP) triggers on unusual data transfer volumes.
- Network Access Control (NAC) flags unauthorized device connection.
- UEBA detects anomalous user behavior deviating from baseline activity.

### Response

- Endpoint is quarantined and user account temporarily disabled.
- Forensic analysis conducted to assess data accessed and copied.
- Legal and HR teams engaged for investigation and mitigation.
- Policy review and stricter device control implemented.

### Lessons Learned

- Insider threats require behavioral analytics and endpoint controls.
- Coordination between IT, HR, and legal is critical.
- Policies must be enforced technically and administratively.

## 10.4 Scenario 3: Ransomware Infection Containment

### Overview

An endpoint becomes infected with ransomware encrypting critical business files and attempting to propagate.

### Detection

- EDR detects suspicious file encryption processes.
- Network segmentation prevents spread to shared drives.
- SIEM correlates alerts from multiple sources indicating ransomware activity.

### Response

- Immediate containment by isolating the infected device.
- Backup restoration initiated for encrypted files.
- Incident Response team conducts root cause analysis.
- Security patches and system hardening applied to prevent re-infection.

### Lessons Learned

- Automated detection and rapid isolation limit damage.
- Regular backups are essential for recovery.
- Post-incident analysis guides prevention measures.

## 10.5 Scenario 4: Web Application Attack

### Overview

Attackers launch a SQL Injection attack against a public-facing web application to access confidential data.

### Detection

- Web Application Firewall (WAF) blocks suspicious HTTP requests.
- SIEM alerts triggered by abnormal query patterns and failed login attempts.
- Logs reviewed for indicators of compromise.

### Response

- Application developers patch the vulnerability.
- WAF rules updated to strengthen protections.
- Incident Response validates no data exfiltration occurred.
- Regular vulnerability assessments scheduled.

### Lessons Learned

- Layered web security controls reduce risk.
- Continuous monitoring and timely patching are critical.
- Collaboration between SOC and development teams enhances security.

# Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)

---

## 4.1 What is EDR?

**Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)** is a cybersecurity technology focused on continuously monitoring and responding to threats on endpoints such as laptops, desktops, servers, and mobile devices.

### Key Functions of EDR:
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Collects data about endpoint activities in real-time.
- **Threat Detection:** Uses behavioral analysis and threat intelligence to identify suspicious activities.
- **Investigation:** Provides tools to analyze and understand endpoint threats.
- **Response:** Enables rapid containment, remediation, and recovery actions on infected devices.
- **Forensics:** Supports detailed root cause analysis and timeline reconstruction after an incident.

## 4.2 Why EDR is Important

- Provides deep visibility into endpoint behavior beyond traditional antivirus.
- Detects advanced threats such as fileless malware, ransomware, and insider threats.
- Enables faster incident response with automated and manual remediation capabilities.
- Helps contain threats at the endpoint before they spread to the network.
- Enhances overall security posture by integrating with SOC workflows and SIEM platforms.

## 4.3 EDR Architecture Overview

EDR solutions typically include:

| Component               | Description                                                        |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Endpoint Agent**      | Software installed on endpoints that collects telemetry data.     |
| **Data Aggregation Server** | Centralized platform that receives and stores endpoint data.    |
| **Detection Engine**    | Analyzes endpoint data using signatures, heuristics, and behavior analytics. |
| **Alerting Module**     | Generates alerts based on suspicious or malicious activity.       |
| **Response Tools**      | Provides containment options such as isolating endpoints or killing processes. |
| **Forensic Tools**      | Allows investigation of endpoint activity and incident root cause. |

## 4.4 Types of Data Collected by EDR

- **Process and Application Activity:** Running processes, executed files, application behaviors.
- **File Activity:** Creation, modification, and deletion of files.
- **Network Connections:** Outbound and inbound connections from the endpoint.
- **User Activity:** Logins, privilege escalations, and command executions.
- **Registry Changes (Windows):** Modifications to system settings.
- **Memory and Disk Artifacts:** Suspicious in-memory activity and artifacts on disk.

---

## 4.5 Common EDR Use Cases

- **Ransomware Detection and Mitigation:** Detecting early signs of ransomware behavior and blocking encryption processes.
- **Malware Detection:** Identifying known and unknown malware through behavior analysis.
- **Insider Threat Monitoring:** Spotting unusual user or process behavior.
- **Threat Hunting:** Enabling analysts to proactively search endpoints for hidden threats.
- **Incident Response:** Rapidly isolating compromised devices to contain outbreaks.

---

## 4.6 Challenges with EDR

- **Data Volume:** Large amounts of telemetry data can overwhelm storage and analysts.
- **False Positives:** Behavioral detection can sometimes trigger benign activities.
- **Complexity:** Requires skilled staff to configure, tune, and investigate alerts.
- **Endpoint Performance Impact:** Agents may consume resources on endpoints.
- **Integration:** Effective use often requires integration with SIEM and SOAR tools.

## 4.7 Best Practices for EDR Deployment

- Deploy EDR agents across all critical endpoints.
- Regularly update detection signatures and behavior models.
- Establish clear incident response workflows based on EDR alerts.
- Train SOC analysts on EDR investigation and response capabilities.
- Integrate EDR with SIEM and SOAR for comprehensive monitoring and automation.
- Continuously tune alerts to balance detection sensitivity and noise reduction.
